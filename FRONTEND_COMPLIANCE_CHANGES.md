# Frontend Compliance Changes - Backend Updates

## Summary

The frontend has been updated to comply with backend changes that removed OCR validation for EID images. EID images are still **mandatory** but are now accepted without validation.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed OCR Validation Calls
- **File:** `src/components/Step2EmiratesIDScan.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Removed import of `validateEmiratesIDWithBackend` from `ocrService.ts`
  - Removed all calls to `validateEmiratesIDWithBackend()` function
  - Removed all validation error handling (name mismatch, invalid ID, wrong side)
  - Removed validation loading states and messages

### 2. ✅ Removed Validation UI Elements
- **File:** `src/components/Step2EmiratesIDScan.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Removed name mismatch popup modal
  - Removed validation error messages
  - Updated processing messages to remove OCR references
  - Changed success messages from "verified" to "captured"

### 3. ✅ Immediate Image Storage
- **File:** `src/components/Step2EmiratesIDScan.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Images are now stored immediately after capture/upload
  - No validation wait time
  - Users can proceed immediately after EID upload

### 4. ✅ OTP Verification (Already Mandatory)
- **File:** `src/App.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ Already implemented correctly
- **Verification:**
  - Lines 188-195: Checks for `otpData.phoneNumber` and `otpData.otp`
  - Lines 212-213: Includes OTP fields in booking request
  - Booking submission is blocked if OTP is missing

### 5. ✅ EID Upload Still Mandatory
- **File:** `src/App.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ Already implemented correctly
- **Verification:**
  - Lines 168-176: Validates `eidFrontImage` is present
  - EID images are still required for booking submission

## What Was Removed

1. ❌ OCR validation API calls (`validateEmiratesIDWithBackend`)
2. ❌ Validation error messages (invalid ID, name mismatch, wrong side)
3. ❌ Name mismatch popup modal
4. ❌ Validation loading states ("Processing Emirates ID... This may take 30-60 seconds")
5. ❌ OCR-related processing messages
6. ❌ Unused variables (`eidFirstName`, `eidLastName`)

## What Was Kept

1. ✅ EID image upload (still mandatory)
2. ✅ EID front and back image capture/upload UI
3. ✅ Image storage functionality
4. ✅ OTP verification (mandatory)
5. ✅ All other booking form fields
6. ✅ All other existing functionality
